title: Welcome to How To Hestia!

**What is Hestia?**

Hestia is an open-source home assistant I designed specifically with my needs and wants in mind. This means there are lots of decisions I made that may not suit your own desires; for example, I prioritized things like Zulip and Discord integration because I had significant communities there and it was very exciting for me to see Hestia connected to those.

That being said, I believe this guide can still be valuable to those who aren't looking to 100% replicate my process. I like to describe this site as "Docs With Feelings". They're certainly technically instructive, and inherit a lot of the canonical "readthedocs" form, but often probe you, the reader, to reflect on why you're exploring the home assistant space, and what you yourself *really* want out of it.

**Who are you, and why did you make Hestia?**

My name is [Shenai](https://shenaichan.github.io) and I'm a recent grad from Carnegie Mellon. I studied Computer Engineering, Human Computer Interaction, and Physical Computing, and the focalizing force of my technical practice is my belief that technology can be a medium for presence across physical distance. 

For this reason, Hestia tends to explore messaging/chat client integrations, as well as playful, quaint, tangible interactions. I call Hestia a "home assistant", but that's not exactly what it is. Hestia is a second memory, an AI chatbot, a manager for IoT devices, a hub for automations via APIs, and a suite of documentation. Hestia is where I conduct much of my hardware/software play these days.
